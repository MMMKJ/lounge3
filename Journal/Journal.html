     Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
     through some interesting places on the way: Walla walla,
     WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO,
     Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

     I saw some Burma Shave style style signs on hte side of the
     road today: "passing cars, when you can't see, May get
     you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing
     any cars.

    My frist day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipod,

    digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
    Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
    with one Segway"
